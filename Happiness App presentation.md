Background
========================================================

- Scientists and sociologists use many ways to try to quantify our contentment in this life.

- For example, the following indices have been proposed 
   - Crime rates
   - Health status
   - Income and disposable income

But is it true that income and happiness are related????
========================================================
If so, then people in India must be very sad, while people in the US must be very happy. But is this true?



```

Introducing the Happiness app
========================================================

The app takes input from the user for:
- their level of happiness 
- their yearly disposable income and 
- the level of sunshine on a particular day.

- - - 

The app then collects and compares data on happiness versus disposable income with the overall objective of proving if there is a definite relationship between money and happiness.
