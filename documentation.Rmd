This is supporting documentation for the Happiness Indicator App developed for the Developing Data Products course.

The app collects and compares data on happiness versus disposable income with the overall objective of proving if there is a definite relationship between money and happiness. 

The app takes input from the user for their level of happiness, their yearly disposable income and the level of sunshine on a particular day. 

Using a very complex formula, an integer result for a happiness score is returned. 

The function used to calculate the happiness score is as follows:

```{r}
happinessfnc <- function(id1, id2, id3) {
        id2 <- as.numeric(id2)
        round(id1^3 * id2^6 * id3^2 * runif(1, 999,1011),0)
}
```

All the code used to prepare the App is available in the GitHub repo under the current branch.
